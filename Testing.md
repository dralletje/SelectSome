# Testing

In both browsers currently supported (Chrome and Firefox)
I should test these things:

### Basic usage
1. Activate the extension
2. click a fullscreen button (eg. on youtube)
3. Try all three options (Windowed, in window and fullscreen)
4. Every option should transform the window into the right "format"
5. Click the "un-fullscreen" button, and it should transform back to a normal tab again.

### Disabling
1. Activate the extension
2. Go to youtube
3. Press the "Browser action" (thus, disabling the extension on youtube)
4. Press the fullscreen button
5. No option menu should appear now, it goes into normal fullscreen
6. Go out of fullscreen again
7. Refresh the page
8. Press the fullscreen button
9. No option menu should appear now, it goes into normal fullscreen
10. Go out of fullscreen again
